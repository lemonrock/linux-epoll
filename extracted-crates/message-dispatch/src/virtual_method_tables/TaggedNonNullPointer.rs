/// A pointer with a tag value for unused bits in the raw pointer.
///
/// Always a total of 64-bits in size, even on on 32-bit systems.
///
/// Consequently, on both Arm32, AArch64 and x86-64 systems, a total of 19 bits is available (in theory, 20 bits are available on x86-64 but this is not made available; if a file descriptor follows this value, an additional bit could be snaffled as raw file descriptors are always unsigned - the top bit is only ever used to signal failure).
/// Additionally, the values `0` to `2^19 - 1` can be special-cased as the virtual method table pointer can never be null.
///
/// Notes:-
///
/// * On a 32-bit system all pointers are normally 32-bit aligned (if they come from the stack or malloc); indeed on Arm systems, they have to be.
/// * On a 64-bit system all pointers are normally 64-bit aligned (if they come from the stack or malloc).
/// * On AArch64 and x86-64 currently the top 16-bits are not used (virtual addresses are a maximum of 48-bit).
/// * On x86-64 (and ?AArch64) the bit 46 (if counting from zero) is always a fixed value, either 0 (for user space) or 1 (for the kernel).
/// * On x86-64, bits 63:48 are a sign-extension of bit 47 - ie all 1s or all 0s.
/// * On all systems, a virtual method table can never be the null pointer (all zeros).
/// * However, 52-bit pointers are proposed for ARMv8.2 and 56-bit pointers by Intel for x86-64 (<https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/managed/2b/80/5-level_paging_white_paper.pdf>), but these features are a way off and will require opt-in by Linux.

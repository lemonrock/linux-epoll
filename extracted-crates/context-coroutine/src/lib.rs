//! #context-coroutine
//! 
//! This is a simple set of extensions to the [context](https://github.com/zonyitoo/context-rs) crate to provide stackful coroutines.
//!
//! The intended use case is mostly for read and write (input and output, I/O) with socket file descriptors.
//!
//! The developers are not associated with the authors of [context](https://github.com/zonyitoo/context-rs) but are extremely grateful for the work they've put into to a superb piece of code.

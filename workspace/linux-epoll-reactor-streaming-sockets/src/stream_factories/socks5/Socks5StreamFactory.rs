		HTTP CONNECT method

The most common form of HTTP tunneling is the standardized HTTP CONNECT method.[1][2] In this mechanism, the client asks an HTTP proxy server to forward the TCP connection to the desired destination. The server then proceeds to make the connection on behalf of the client. Once the connection has been established by the server, the proxy server continues to proxy the TCP stream to and from the client. Only the initial connection request is HTTP - after that, the server simply proxies the established TCP connection.

This mechanism is how a client behind an HTTP proxy can access websites using SSL or TLS (i.e. HTTPS). Proxy servers may also limit connections by only allowing connections to the default HTTPS port 443, whitelisting hosts, or blocking traffic which doesn't appear to be SSL.
Example negotiation

The client connects to the proxy server and requests tunneling by specifying the port and the host computer it would like to connect to. The port is used to indicate the protocol being requested.[3]

CONNECT example.host.com:22 HTTP/1.1
Proxy-Authorization: Basic encoded-credentials

If the connection was allowed and the proxy has connected to the specified host then the proxy will return a 2XX success response.[3]

HTTP/1.1 200 OK

/// Does not contain the root, empty label.
///
/// RFC 2065 asserts that the maximum number of labels is 127; this makes sense if every label bar the last (which is Root) is 1 byte long and so occupies 2 bytes.
/// However, the maximum reasonable length is an IPv6 reverse DNS look up, which requires 33 labels (32 for each nibble and 2 for `ip6.arpa` less 1 for the omitted root label) of a `SRV` entry such as `_mqtt._tcp`, thus 35 labels.

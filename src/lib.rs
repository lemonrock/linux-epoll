//! #linux-epoll
//! 
//! This is a rust library.
//!
//!
//! ## Conditional Compilation Features
//!
//! ### `assume-file-descriptors-are-never-duplicated`
//!
//! Enable the feature `assume-file-descriptors-are-never-duplicated` to eliminate syscalls to remove file descriptors from an epoll instance before `close`-ing them.
//! This feature is disabled by default.
//!
//! If file descriptors are duplicated (eg in FFI code) then it is possible that closing a file descriptor may result in an epoll instance still generating events for it, causing a memory leak (or worse; it rapidly gets confusing).
//! Ordinarily, modern applications do not need to duplicate file descriptors that are attached to an epoll instance and so enabling this feature produces a performance win.

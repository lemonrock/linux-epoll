		// likewise, we have a problem with client and server initiated connections - they will need different stream_user.
		// likewise, we need to be able to choose a different stream_user for HTTP, HTTPS etc on different server listener ports as we provide different services.
		// and that is before the impact of ALPN.

		// we can punt a lot of this into stream user - it would need an integer key to make its decisions with.
		// but that is memory poor for the arena.

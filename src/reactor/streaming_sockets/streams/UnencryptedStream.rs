/// An unencrypted (raw) stream.
///
/// Only really useful in 2019 for implementing a HTTP => HTTPS delegate, and, perhaps, to support AMQP, LDAP, SMTP, IMAP and POP3 'upgrades' to TLS (eg `STARTTLS`).
/// However, although all of these 'upgrade' approaches should be considered potentially insecure as of 2019.
/// RFC 8314 recommends not using `STARTTLS` for email protocols (`SMTP`, `IMAP` and `POP3`).
///
/// Vectored reads and vectored writes are not supported (although they could be) because they do not compose well when also using TLS streams; since most modern protocols are TLS-based, the a vectored read or write operation is much less useful than it once was.
///
/// Likewise, sendfile is not directly supported, although if (ever) Rustls gets support the Linux's kernel implementation of a TLS-encrypted sendfile, we may add support for it.

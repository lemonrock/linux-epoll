/// A trait to make common the differences between TLS server streams, TLS client streams and unencrypted streams.

/// Also offers wrapper implementations of `io::Read` and `io::Write`, but it advisable to use `read_data()` and `write_data()` in preference.

	/// Type of the information available to the stream after handshaking has completed.

	/// Information available to the stream after handshaking has completed.
	///
	/// Constructing this information is slightly expensive and may involve malloc, so it is advisable to only call this method once.
	///
	/// Since a stream is only made available after handshaking has been successful, this method always succeeds.
	///
	/// For a unencrypted stream, nothing useful is available as no handshaking occurs, although if support for `STARTTLS` in LDAP, SMTP, POP3 and IMAP is added it may be slightly useful.

	///
	/// Appears to the user of this API to be blocking, but in practice it uses a coroutine.
	fn read_data(&mut self, read_into_buffer: &mut [u8]) -> Result<usize, CompleteError>;

	/// Write data.
	///
	/// Appears to the user of this API to be blocking, but in practice it uses a coroutine.
	fn write_data(&mut self, write_from_buffer: &[u8]) -> Result<usize, CompleteError>;

	/// Flush written data.
	///
	/// Not particularly useful, and there is no need to use this before calling `read_data()`, `write_data()` or `finish()`, all of which are self-flushing.
